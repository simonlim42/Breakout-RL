# Breakout-RL: Reinforcement Learning for Atari Breakout

## Project Overview

Breakout-RL is a project dedicated to implementing Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for playing the Atari Breakout game using Python and OpenAI Gym. Within this project, we have developed and compared the performance of both the Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Rainbow DQN algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Deep Q-Network (DQN)

DQN is a foundational algorithm in deep reinforcement learning. It learns to play Breakout by iteratively improving its action-selection strategy based on experience replay and a target network. Our DQN implementation includes:

- Experience replay: Storing and sampling previous transitions to reduce correlation between consecutive samples.
- Target network: Updating the Q-values using a separate target network to stabilize learning.

### Rainbow DQN

Rainbow DQN is an extension of the original DQN algorithm that combines various improvements to enhance performance. Our implementation of Rainbow DQN integrates the following techniques:

- Double Q-learning: Reducing overestimation of Q-values by using two Q-networks.
- Prioritized Experience Replay: Sampling transitions based on TD-error priorities.
- Dueling DQN: Separating state-value and action-advantage functions to improve value estimation.

## Results and Performance

We evaluated the performance of DQN and Rainbow DQN on the Atari Breakout game over a set number of episodes. The performance metrics, learning curves, and visualizations can be found in the `results` directory.
